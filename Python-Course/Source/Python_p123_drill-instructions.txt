Python p123 - Drill Description:

For this drill, you will need to gather all of the drills that you have previously completed for this course and write a new script that will use each of the concepts that you had previously used to complete this drill assignment.

Your new script will need to provide the user with a graphical user interface that includes two buttons allowing the user to browse their own system and select a source directory and a destination directory. Your script should also show those selected directory paths in their own corresponding text fields.

Next, your script will need to provide a button for the user to execute a function that should iterate through the source directory, checking for the existence of any files that end with a “.txt” file extension and if so, cut the qualifying files and paste them within the selected destination directory.

Finally, your script will need to record the file names that were moved and their corresponding modified time-stamps into a database and print out those text files and their modified time-stamps to the console.

Requirements:

* Your script will need to use Python 3, the Tkinter module, and the OS module.

* Your script will need to use the listdir() method from the OS module to iterate through all files within a specific directory.

* Your script will need to use the path.join() method from the OS module to concatenate the file name to its file path, forming an absolute path.

* Your script will need to use the getmtime() method from the OS module to find out the latest date the file has been created or last modified.

* Your script will need to create a database to record the qualifying file and corresponding modified time-stamp.

* Your script will need print each file ending with a “.txt” file extension and its corresponding mtime to the console.

* Your script will need to use the move() method from the Shutil module to cut all qualifying files and paste them within the destination directory.

Additional Setup Instructions:
To complete this final drill assignment, you will need to use the directory you had previously created on your system from an earlier drill assignment.

This directory should have at least 10 different files types, two of which should be text documents that end with the “.txt” file extension.
